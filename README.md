[Laravel 5.7 Vue.js Admin Dashboard for App](http://szlogin.com)

## Introduction

There are many Laravel+Vue.js starter kit available but none of them are complete enough to get started. Some lacks with basic functionality like authentication, some with sample CRUD module, some with responsive layout etc. I tried to create one starter kit with some basic features like authentication, registration, user profile with a sample task module which is built on latest version of bootstrap.This script can be handy enough for your new Laravel+Vue.js project & will surely speed-up your project development time. If you are working first time on Laravel+Vue.js or learning Vue.js then this is perfect script to get started.

### Functions:
- Admin Dashboard
- User Management
- Group Management
- Country Management
- Advertisement Management
- SMS
- Chart
- Multi File upload
